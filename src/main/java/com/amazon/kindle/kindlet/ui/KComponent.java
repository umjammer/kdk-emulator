 * on the Kindle derive from KComponent. Components that do not implemented
 * Focus2DTraversable may not behave as expected under the default focus
 * traversal policy. Much like Swing's JComponent, this class extends Container
 * to ensure the class hierarchy makes sense, even though most subclasses will
 * not be containers. Serialization of this class is not supported in this
 * version.
