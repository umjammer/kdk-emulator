/**
 * A component which displays an image. Support for various modes of image
 * scaling and alignment is provided. When creating a KImage or setting an image
 * via setImage(Image) this component blocks until the image is ready. Without
 * blocking, layout is very difficult, since the desired width and height are
 * unknown during validation. If the image is scaled, the scaled version is
 * computed asynchronously. If the component is required to paint itself before
 * the scaled version is ready, the available pixels will be drawn. Later when
 * the full image is ready another repaint will be issued automatically.
 * Developers can override onImageReady() to change this behavior. This class is
 * not thread safe - methods should be called from the AWT event thread.
 * Serialization of this class is not supported in this version.

 * @see Serialized Form
