     * input is translated into column traversal. Rows and columns can be
     * "spanned" by repeating references to the same object in multiple indices.
     * For example; a grid containing a text field above to buttons could be
     * setup as such:
     *
     * <pre>
     * KTextArea myTextField = new KTextArea();
     * new Component[][] = new Component[][] {

     *     }
     * };
     * </pre>

     * In the preceding example navigation would go up to the text field from
     * the "okay" button, right from the "okay" button to the "cancel" button,
     * and up from the "cancel" button to the text field. Furthermore, this
     * policy "weights" previous navigation steps higher when choosing how to
     * exit a spanned set of Component entries in the traversal grid so
     * navigating up from cancel to the text field would would cause down to go
     * back to the "cancel" button. Inversely navigating up from the "okay"
     * button to the text field would cause down to go back to the "okay"
     * button. null values can be used to create "space" in the grid which the
     * focus traversal policy will always skip over. For example;
     *
     * <pre>
     * new Component[][] = new Component[][] {
     *     {
     *         new KTextField(), new KTextField(), new KTextField()
     *     }, {
     *         new KButton(&quot;okay&quot;), null, new KButton(&quot;cancel&quot;)
     *     }, {
     *         new KTextField(), new KTextField(), new KTextField()
     *     },
     * };
     * </pre>
     *
     * , would have "After" (i.e. "Right") navigation go from the "okay" button
     * to the "cancel" button skipping over the grid index at [1][1]. Similarly
     * navigation down from the text field at index [0][1] would move the focus
     * to the text field at index [2][1].
