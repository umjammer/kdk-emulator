/**
 * A Focus2DTraversalPolicy which determines focus motion based on the pixel
 * location of the components within the focus cycle root. No wrapping occurs at
 * the edges. The default component for this policy is simply the first
 * component. The first component is the component in the upper-left most
 * position, based on its mid-point. The last component is the component in the
 * lower-right most position, based on its mid-point. This behavior may change
 * to be Locale aware in the future. When determining what component to select
 * based on a left, right, up or down input the heursitic determines the
 * candidate as follows: Eliminate the current component from consideration.
 * Test the current focus owner's bounds against all eligible children of the
 * focus cycle root recursively (see the accept method for details on
 * eligibility and the ability of subclasses to modify this decision). If the
 * two components intersect use either a point retrieved from the
 * Focus2DTraversable.getEntryPoint() or a point which is the midpoint on the
 * side of the component farthest from the focus owner and focus candidate
 * respectively. If the two components do not intersect use either a point
 * retrieved from the Focus2DTraversable.getEntryPoint() or a point which is the
 * midpoint on the side of the component closest to the focus owner and focus
 * candidate respectively. Determine the best candidate among all of the focus
 * cycle root's child to receive focus favoring intersection, orthogonal
 * alignment, and tangental alignment respectively. Within the best of the three
 * "alignment groups" for which a match was found determine the best group
 * member based on shortest distance. Ties are broken by how much of a component
 * is orthogonally aligned with the focus owner then by container order. Like
 * the standard Java focus traversal policy, if a container has children who are
 * focusable and it is focusable it will not be eligible to receive the focus.
 * If, however, it has no children it can receive the focus. Threading Note :
 * given the caveat that a Container's tree lock should be acquired prior to
 * performing a focus traversal, this class is generally threadsafe.
