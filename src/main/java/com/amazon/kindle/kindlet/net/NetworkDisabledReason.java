 * Represents a reason for why access to the network is disabled. Disabled is a

 * determines that the network is disabled, it is unlikely that the network will
 * become available again during the life of the application. It is recommended
 * that, once disabled, developers only attempt to initiate a new network
 * connection when explicitly asked by the user. Note: This class is implemented
 * as a type-safe set of constants. New reasons may be introduced in the future,
 * so applications should always handle the case where none of these reasons
 * match.
