/**
 * Contains constants for the Kindle specific hardware keys. Not all Kindle
 * devices will produce keystrokes with all of these constants. In particular,
 * some Kindle models have substantially different keyboard layouts. When
 * designing a user experience developers should be particularly careful of
 * combinations involving the 'Alt' key. This key is used to activate the
 * numeric keys on the Kindle DX. Example Kindle Keyboard Additionally, the Alt
 * key (KeyEvent.VK_ALT) does not produce any key events on its own - but will
 * still appear as a modifier for other keys. Several keys have special
 * behaviors, depending upon the state of the system. The Menu and Text keys
 * both are only delivered to the application if the application has not
 * registered a respective menu for them. See KindletContext.setMenu(KMenu) and
 * KindletContext.setTextOptionPane(KTextOptionPane) for more details. The Back
 * key is delivered to the application, but if it is not consumed returns the
 * user to the last activity before entering the application. It is recommended
 * that developers do not consume the back key if the application has no logical
 * "back". The Alt-Shift-G key combination is reserved by the system to take
 * screen shots. The volume keys are controlled by the Kindle system and not
 * available to applications. Home is reserved for exiting applications and is
 * not available for use by the application. Since: 1.0 See Also:KeyEvent
